    "I’m really proud of how well I did on the MCQs overall. I worked through most of them with Aarush, which helped a lot as we could support each other with questions we didn’t fully understand. There were only a couple of questions I would have gotten wrong if it hadn’t been for him explaining things to me. One example was with binary, where I miscounted a number, and he pointed it out. I feel like I learned a lot through this experience and gained a lot of confidence for the AP test. I now have a better understanding of topics like reasonable time algorithms and binary search algorithms, which I didn’t know as well before. I’m happy to be better prepared for these concepts when the AP test comes around."
