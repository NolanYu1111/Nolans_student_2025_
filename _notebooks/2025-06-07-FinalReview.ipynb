    "This year in CSP has been an incredible learning experience. At the start, I had limited coding knowledge and often froze the first time an error popped up, but now I feel much more confident building projects. Wrestling with stubborn bugs and pushing through late-night debugging sessions taught me how to design solutions in code—and how to break big problems into bite-sized steps. Overcoming those early struggles didn’t just sharpen my technical skills; it reshaped the way I face challenges—analyzing them logically, experimenting creatively, and persevering until I succeed."

For me in general, I have come to realize wether I like it or not that coding is in many aspects of this. For example, BioInformatics using datascience such as database managment and API data integration.\n",

    "I consider my work on Cantella to be my proudest achievement. Building this interactive study-tool website brought together all my CSP learnings and pushed me to level up. Working with a team of six under an AGILE framework taught me how to break down features, track progress, and adapt quickly. As the backend developer, I designed RESTful endpoints to manage personalized study modules, implemented full CRUD for user progress, and integrated third-party educational resources. Setting up secure authentication flows and deploying the service on AWS EC2 with Nginx showed me the end-to-end path from prototype to production. Tackling these challenges was rewarding and really underscored how much I’ve grown this year.\n",
