    "Operating systems generally rely on resource management tools to detect and control processes that consume excessive CPU time or memory, which can occur in cases of infinite loops or long-running scripts.\n",

    "Process Scheduling and CPU Time Allocation:\n",
    "Operating systems like Windows, Linux, and macOS use process schedulers to allocate CPU time to running processes. If a process enters an infinite loop, the operating system might allow it to run for a certain time, but if the process consumes too much CPU time or system resources, it can be terminated or throttled. This is done through various monitoring mechanisms and resource limits.\n",
    "\n",
    "Resource Limits (e.g., ulimits on Linux):\n",
    "Linux-based systems have built-in tools such as ulimit that can restrict the amount of CPU time or memory a process can use. For example, setting a CPU time limit for a process ensures that any long-running or infinite-loop process is automatically terminated once it exceeds the limit.\n",

    "Timeouts and Watchdogs:\n",
    "Many operating systems implement watchdog timers for specific processes. These timers monitor the execution of long-running operations, and if the process takes too long, it is terminated or restarted. For example, a systemd service in Linux may be configured with a TimeoutSec directive, which forces a process to stop if it runs for too long."

While heuristics can speed up the process by simplifying the problem-solving approach, they typically do sacrifice accuracy or optimality in exchange for speed. Exact algorithms, on the other hand, guarantee an optimal solution but may take much longer, especially for large or complex problems. Thus, heuristics generally provide faster solutions but with a trade-off in terms of solution quality or accuracy."

While it significantly reduces the computational time compared to exact algorithms, it does not guarantee an optimal solution. The solution provided by the Nearest Neighbor algorithm is often a good approximation, but it is not guaranteed to be the best possible route.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, as the number of cities increases, the gap between the heuristic solution and the optimal solution can indeed grow exponentially. This is because the Nearest Neighbor algorithm tends to make decisions based on local information, and as the problem size grows, these local decisions can lead to suboptimal global outcomes. Exact algorithms for TSP, such as branch-and-bound or dynamic programming, can guarantee the optimal solution but are much more computationally expensive."
