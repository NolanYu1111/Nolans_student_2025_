    "**Explanation of Highlighted Feature**\n",
    "\n",
    "- One of the standout features I chose to highlight in Gemini is the ChatTutor integration. This feature goes beyond just offering a chatbot; it provides a clean and user-friendly frontend UI that allows users to seamlessly interact with the AI to get homework help. Users can ask questions, and the chatbot processes them in real-time, providing helpful and relevant answers. Additionally, ChatTutor integrates with other features, such as logging user queries and responses, so users can keep track of past interactions. The data collected from these interactions can also be used to improve responses and offer more personalized homework tips. This not only provides an efficient and effective way to help users with their homework, but it also allows us to continuously enhance the user experience by integrating the chatbot with other helpful features.\n",
